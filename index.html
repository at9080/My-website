   Arsenal are the only team still in existence that has never been relegated. They have been in the top flight of English football since the 1919/20 campaign. 2. They are given the name Arsenal, and the nickname 'The Gunners', because they were formed by a group of cannon makers at the Woolwich Arsenal in 1886.
